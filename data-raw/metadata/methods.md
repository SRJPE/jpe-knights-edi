## Trap equipment

Two in-line 8-foot diameter rotary screw traps.

## Current trap locations

Sacramento River (River Mile 88.5) near Knights Landing, California.

## Monitoring schedule

From September through June. Continuously trapping except under high flows and unsafe working conditions. Serviced daily approximately every 24 hours, more often if needed due to high debris amounts or fish catch. Trapping ceases when conditions are unsafe.

## Daily environmental data

Daily environmental data collected are flow (cubic feet per second) recorded from the CDEC Gauging station (Sacramento River Below Wilkins Slough (WLK)); water temperature (Celsius); river depth (meters); turbidity (nephelometric turbidity units); dissolved oxygen (percent); conductivity (microSiemens per centimeter), velocity (meters per second), and light penetration (centimeters).

## Fish measurements

Fork length measurements to the nearest mm taken for all Chinook salmon and steelhead. For chinook salmon: 100 randomly selected salmon per run: spring-, fall-, winter- or late-fall runs. Run assigned by length-at-date criteria (Fisher 1992). For non-salmonid fish, first 10 measured for total length and recorded to the nearest mm.

## Fish counts

All fish not measured are tallied by hand.

## Trap efficiency trials

Utilize trap-captured Chinook salmon falling within size criteria for unmarked: fall-, spring-, and late-fall run. Utilize trap-captured Chinok salmon falling within the size crieria for hatchery origin fish: fall- and late-fall run. If trap captures are too low for efficiency trails, fall-run Chinook salmon are obtained from Coleman National Fish Hatchery (CNFH). •	Frequency of once per week from December to May across variable flow and environmental conditions as catch totals and/or hatchery availability allows. •	A minimum of three consecutive days of fishing after the release date is required for a release to be included in analyses. •	Mortality between the release point and the trap is assumed to be negligible. •	Release site approximately 0.5-mile upstream of the trapping site. 

## Trap efficiency marks

Salmon captured in the RSTs are marked with Bismarck Brown Y (BBY) or Methylene Blue whole body stain. Salmon obtained from CNFH are marked with a Visible Implant Elastomer (VIE) Tag.
